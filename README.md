# About OWASP Seasides

Welcome to the Annual OWASP SeaSides InfoSec event. 

Through OWASP [Bangalore chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Bangalore) we aim to provide free of cost premium workshops and talks to all the participants. We plan to have Workshop on **3rd** **to 5th March 2020 \(9:00 AM to 5:00 PM\).**

[nullcon](https://nullcon.net/website/) has been doing a great job getting researchers from all over the world to India. If you are coming for [nullcon 2020](https://nullcon.net/website/) then we are giving you more reasons to come early and participate in [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) and [null ](https://null.co.in/)community events.

If you want to be part of event and speak at the events then please fill the CFI \(Call for ideas\) form.
