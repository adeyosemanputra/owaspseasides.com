# Build your own hacking gadgets

About The Trainer: Seedon D'Souza \(Security Researcher\) Opensource Hardware

What: Learn how to build your own hacking gadgets, a hands-on workshop on building a WiFi Deauther & a Bad USB, as you dive into the Arduino project and your first micro-controller.

HOW: groups will be made and provided with an ESP 8266 and a Digispark module. Attendees will get hands-on experience on programming a micro-controller and will get to take home their new WiFi Deauther and Bad USB.

WHY: This workshop introduces the audience to micro-controllers & hardware, disproves some of the myths about hardware being complicated. The author of the workshop has experience building control system for UGV/UAV and other embedded systems.

**Scan for WiFi devices, block selected connections, create dozens of networks and confuse WiFi scanners! built around a ESP 8266 microcontroller**
