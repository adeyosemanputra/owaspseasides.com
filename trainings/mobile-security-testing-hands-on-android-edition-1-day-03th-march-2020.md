# Mobile Security Testing Hands-On - Android Edition \(1 day\)  -03th March 2020

**Training summary**

This course teaches you how to analyse an Android app for security vulnerabilities, by going through the different phases of testing, including dynamic testing, static analysis and reverse engineering. The instructors will share their experiences and many small tips and tricks to attack mobile apps.

At the beginning of the course we start by giving an overview of the Android Platform and itâ€™s Security Architecture.  It is no longer mandatory for students to bring their own Android device, instead a cloud-based virtualized Android device will be provided for each student. 

**These are some of the topics that will be covered during the course:**

* Frida crash course to kick-start with dynamic instrumentation on Android apps 
* Function Hooking in a Hybrid app framework \(Flutter\) to reverse engineer custom Keystore implementation and bypass SSL pinning 
* Identifying and exploiting a real word deeplink vulnerability 
* Application repackaging to defeat Network Security Configuration
* Usage of dynamic Instrumentation with Frida to break end-to-end encryption \(Frida/Brida\)
* bypass Frida detection mechanisms
* bypass multiple root detection mechanisms

**At the end of the day small groups will be created \(2-3 students\) and time will be given to investigate an app with the newly learned skills. Every team is then encouraged to make a short presentation about the analysed vulnerability.**

**After successful completion of this course, students will have a better understanding of how to test for vulnerabilities in Android apps, how to mitigate them and how to execute tests consistently. The course is based on the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide \(MSTG\) and is conducted by one of the author himself. The OWASP MSTG is a comprehensive and open source guide about mobile security testing for both iOS and Android.** 

**Target audience**

According to the feedback we have collected from our previous trainings, students who have mobile application development and application penetration testing experience enjoyed and benefited the most from the course.   
  
**Attendee requirements** 

The participants should have a basic understanding of mobile apps, interest in security and learning new things and basic experience with the command line. Besides that, the following technical prerequisites need to be fulfilled by the participants in order to be able to execute and follow all exercises:

* Full administrative access, in case of any issues with the environment
* VirtualBox installed
* Genymotion Desktop installed \(Install device Google Pixel 2 with Android 9 - API 28\)
* Android Studio installed 
* An Android hardware device is not needed by the participants and will also not be provided. The Android hands-on exercises of the training will instead be executed in Genymotion Desktop.

**Attendees will be provided with the following content:**

* * tools and scripts used during the training and
  * several iOS Apps that are used for the exercises.
  * All slides in PDF format 
  * Access to private Github repo that contains
